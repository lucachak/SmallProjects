the app is meant to help me with some of my daily annoying stuff.

    the whole idea/concept is to bring an app that can :
    
    [X] organize my files. 
    [X] update my system.
    [ ] create visualizer to update as a new popup
    [X] being able to connect to a DB
    [ ] api control for testing. (simple crud api, for test.)


    [ ] upload the Code folder properly.
